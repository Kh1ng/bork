# [Bork!](https://bork.coltonspurgin.tech/)

Bork is a social media app for dog people. Just a Twitter clone with more dogs, entirely for learning purposes.

## Tech I used
- Typescript
- SQL
- tRPC
- Vercel
- Clerk
- GitHub Actions
- Jest

## What I've Learned
Besides the normal minor refactors and updates, a big hurdle was that Planet-scale decided to shut down its free tier. I ended up migrating to Railway and learning a lot about databases. I also am feeling really good about CI & CD through GitHub actions.

## The To-Do List
- I'd like to get random pictures of dogs from a free API and assign them to new users.
- More testing in-depth testing, 100% coverage.





Prisma stuff I forget a lot:
```bash
#start dev db
npx prisma generate

# To manage DB (optional)
npx prisma studio
```
